Hello and welcome to my LinkedIn jobs web scraping project.

In this project, I extract information about 1000 Data Science jobs. For each job, I collect the name of the company, job title, location,
seniority level, and skills required. 

This project was very interesting to me since I'm new to the field of Data analytics and I wanted to find out where most jobs in the field where located
as well as the skills I would need to learn to be successful in the field.

Moreover, I will use result of this project to perform data cleaning in Python using the Pandas library. After the data is cleaned, I will proceed 
to perform some SQL queries to extract some interesting information about the job market in the Data field!

Please take a look at this follow up work in the following repository: https://github.com/ayanwu98/LinkedIn-Jobs-Data-Cleaning-and-SQL-queries.
